- Build: Run make to create executable main.
- Usage: ./main

Makefile        -> builds an executable named main.

graph.h         -> Header file for graph ADT.
graph.cpp       -> main file containing c++ code. Implements a graph ADT and displays it
                   using an adjecy list representation.

board.h         -> Header for for hex board containing method definitions.
board.cpp       -> Implementation file for the hex board. Handles board printing and game logic.

disjointset.h   -> Header file for union-find algorithm for disjoint sets.
disjointset.cpp -> Implementation file for union-find algorithm. Joins individual player nodes
                   using the hex board representation. Finds if a path exists.

main.cpp        -> Main program. Creates the game board and players WHITE and BLACK. Black goes
                   first. They alternate each time filling the hex board randomly. A winner is
                   after every move.

README          -> You're reading it.

I learned more about working classes and utilizing the members from one class in another. I also
learned about the union-find algorithm for disjoint sets.
