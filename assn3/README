Makefile     -> builds an executable named graph.

graph.cpp    -> main file containing c++ code. Implements a graph ADT and displays it using a 2D matrix representation. Graph is run through dijkstra's algorithm (undirectional only, I couldn't implement bidirectional on time.)

Two tests are performed. Both graphs are of size 1,000 (graphs are obtrusive so they're not printed to the standard output). The first graph has a density of .1 and the second of .01. Weights, sources and destinations vertices for both graphs are randomly assigned. Weight has a range of 0-200. Source and destination a range of 0-999.

Using time from the terminal with the above criteria, undirectional search took:
real    0m0.987s

README       -> You're reading it.

I learned more about working with dijkstra's, unfortunately I ran out of time before I could implement dijkstra's bidirectional correctly.
