Assn  : Hw6 Game of Hex and GUI

Included in this project are two implementations of the game of Hex.

~ Folder command_line includes a version of the game which can be run from
any unix terminal.
** Build: run 'make'
** Use: ./main

~ Folder GUI contains src which includes the source for the GUI implementation. If you would like to build it yourself, YOU WILL NEED Qt5 Creator.

~ Folder GUI contain binaries (for Windows, Ubuntu 13, and OS X)
  These contain a GUI implementation of the game of HEX. The GUI was written
  in Qt5. Tested ONLY on OS X 10.9, Ubuntu 13 64-bit and Windows 7 64-bit. Windows exe is included in
  GUI/binaries/Windows_7/Hex.exe

  ** Use: double-click on app or exe to run.

AI does 1,000 game simulations of a n*n board game. This takes a while as it is single threaded only.

I learned a lot about creating GUI's for this project.
