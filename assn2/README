Assn  : Hw2 (graph)
Makefile     -> builds an executable named graph.

graph.cpp    -> main file containing c++ code. Implements a graph ADT and displays it using a 2D matrix representation.

README       -> You're reading it.

I learned more about object oriented programming such classes and constructors in C++ and how they can be used to encapsulate data.

Something interesting that I noticed was that omitting the "this" pointer had no effect on my functions and I learned that it was entirely optional.
