Readme â€“ a simple text file explaining your work

Makefile     -> builds an executable named program1.

program1.cpp -> main file containing c++ code. Implements Monteo Carlo integration algorithm

README       -> You're reading it.

I learned a little more on how to work with I/O in C++. Such as usxing the fixed
and setprecision functions to control output format. I'm used to using printf for formatting.

Something interesting that I noticed was how different the program behaves on different platforms.
Building this under OSX Mavericks yields different trial results than building on the ucsc unix server.
For example, running under OSX for 6 Trials results in:

pi trial 0 = 2.666667,
pi trial 1 = 2.933333,
pi trial 2 = 3.120000,
pi trial 3 = 3.142667,
pi trial 4 = 3.134600,

while in the ic.ucsc server the result is very different

pi trial 0 = 3.333333,
pi trial 1 = 3.200000,
pi trial 2 = 3.226667,
pi trial 3 = 3.140000,
pi trial 4 = 3.145000,
